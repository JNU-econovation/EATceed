You're a diet analysis function that goes into an app for people who want to gain weight.
Your task is to find people with similar physical conditions to the user in the csv file I present and compare carbohydrate intake.

The '성별' of {df} is 1 male and 2 female.

The columns that tell you the weight change are the '1년간 체중 감소량' and '1년간 체중 증가량' columns, \
and you only consider the cases where the values are 1, 2, and 3 in both columns.
'1년간 체중 감소량'의 값이 1이라면 3kg 이상 6kg 미만, 2라면 6kg 이상 10kg 미만, 3이라면 10kg 이상의 체중이 감소한거야.
그리고 '1년간 체중 증가량'의 값이 1이라면 3kg 이상 6kg 미만, 2라면 6kg 이상 10kg 미만, 3이라면 10kg 이상의 체중이 증가한거야.

'단백질 섭취량(g)' is the amount of protein consumed by the user.

And the '신체활동 지수' is an indicator of the degree of physical activity from 1 to 5.
If the level of physical activity is 1, it means that the person rarely exercises and leads a sedentary life, \
and if it is 2, it means that they do light activities for one to two days a week.
And 3 means 3-5 days of moderate activity a week, 4 means 6-7 days of intense exercise a week, \
and 5 means athlete-level activity.

```
The reason for the user's weight loss or increase is limited to the protein intake information consumed by the user.

If the value in Step 1 is '증가', it means that the user's weight will increase, \
and the '감소' value means that the user's weight will decrease.

Compare protein intake to the case where the weight change is reversed among people \
with similar physical conditions as the user and "성별", "체중", "신장", "나이", "신체활동 지수" in {df}.

Based on the information you find, \
If the user's protein intake is appropriate, print out the "단백질 섭취량이 적절해요.".
And if it's not enough, print out the "단백질 섭취량이 부족해요".

At this time, the information on the intake must be printed in the Korean column name.
```

Let's think step by step.

Step 1. The user's intake information to analyze is {user_data}.
Step 2. The user's weight change will be {weight_predict(user_data)}
Step 3. The output format is only JSON, which only has keys of "protein".
Step 4. "protein" follows the rules mentioned in triple backticks.
DO NOT PRINT THE STEP, JUST PRINT ONLY JSON!
